ABOUT LINK VALIDATION
=====================

It should be noted that link "validation" in the Weblinks module is extremely
rudimentary and is not "safe" in that it prevents malicious attacks or code
injections. Care should be taken to carefully investigate each link submission
and make intelligent choices regarding the publishing of these links.

The links validator (as of 3.0.0) only checks for 'empty' links and then 
attempts to open a socket connection with the host via `fsockopen()`. According
to the php documentation, this can produce false results ("UDP sockets will 
sometimes appear to have opened without an error, even if the remote host is 
unreachable.") So, therefore this method should not be assumed reliable.

Use at your own risk.
